I am an aspiring Data Scientist with a diverse background in mathematics and physics. I hold a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics from St. Olaf College and a master's degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of Washington. I have done research at the University of Washington working on molecular dynamics simulations and at Los Alamos National Laboratory working in the intersection of recurrent neural networks and material science. Although I am out of school, I plan for my journey through math, physics, and data science to be a lifelong endeavor. There are countless interesting problems to explore, and I can always improve my skills. Besides doing math and physics problems, I also like to listen to jazz music, play video and board games, and lift weights.
